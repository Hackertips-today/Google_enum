Based on similar patterns and context from Google-related debugging 
I have found these headers in response from google, I looked up the 
details on them and this is what I came up with:

STHH	Service or subsystem health issue.
EPRRS	Error in request routing or a specific endpoint.
EPR	Error in endpoint processing (possibly an API or service).
FHEH	Frontend handling error (e.g., a failure in a UI layer).
GSI	Google Service Identifier (e.g., backend service errors).
RR	Request routing error (could relate to load balancing).
HMF	Header or metadata failure (e.g., parsing, missing headers).
STQF	State query failure or a storage-related issue.

STSFSPSF	Likely related to stateful service failures.
SCZFI	Session or caching zone failure.
